-	examine all claims from 1/1/08 - 12/31/10 without regard to timing of interview

Ok, great. Let's do it in the simplest way (so correct me if this is not it):

-	use claims data from HRS, without restrictions for length of ffs coverage and non-hmo, but presumably reflecting ffs beneficiaries for the most part; 
-	examine all claims from 1/1/08 - 12/31/10 without regard to timing of interview 
-	assess total frequency of each code and the number of unique Rs with any occurrence
-	if possible, distinguish those from inpatient vs outpt claims (I think they will all be found within inpatient, even if it is an "ambulatory" procedure)

And no big rush- any time in the next couple of weeks would be fine.
Thank you!!

Hi Amy,

This shouldn't take too long. I'd guess a couple of hours at the most. Would you want just a count of unique respondents that had any occurrence of one of these procedures, or a more detailed look counting how many occurrences per R. 

Would it be related to an interview (so the usual check for ffs Medicare some period before or after and then look at specific time periods?) or simply the presence of the procedure? Linking to interviews would add some time, but we have the basic code written to do it so I'd think it would still take less than a day.

Hi Rebecca,
Could you tell me how much trouble it would be to find the prevalence of the following procedure codes in our HRS sample?  If it's easiest, it could be just over 1-2 years of claims.  If this would take a significant amount of time than we can just forget it.
Thank you!
Amy

Inpatient:  Any claim ICD-9 procedure code of:
"	00.50 -- Implantation of cardiac resynchronization pacemaker without mention of defibrillation, total system [crt-p]
"	00.51 -- Implantation of cardiac resynchronization defibrillator, total system [crt-d]
"	00.52 -- Implantation or replacement of transvenous lead [electrode] into left ventricular coronary venous system
"	00.53 -- Implantation or replacement of cardiac resynchronization pacemaker pulse generator only [crt-p]
"	00.54 -- Implantation or replacement of cardiac resynchronization defibrillator pulse generator device only [crt-d]
"	37.94 -- Implantation or replacement of automatic cardioverter/defibrillator, total system [aicd]

Outpatient: any of the ICD-9 procedure codes above
OR CPT procedure codes:
