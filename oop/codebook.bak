This codebook file documents the decisions made when coding the
data cleaning and imputations for the dataset created in
the file oop_mc_2010_2yr.txt along with a summary of the
sections in the outline text file

General project description:
Tabulate out of pocket costs, medicare paid costs and impute additional
nursing home costs and replacement costs of informal, unpaid, caregivers
in the last 2 and 5 years of life.
Original datasets include the HRS surveys (2002-2010 exit interviews,
1998-2008 core interviews, and the restricted dataset received in Nov. 2013),
the oopme_final.dta dataset recieved in July 2013,
and the helpers_hours.dta dataset received in May 2014, and
HRS linked Medicare claims 2000-2010.

********************************************************
**Pull exit and restricted interviews and mc xwalk id**
********************************************************
Begin with the cleaned exit (decedent) interview dataset (cleaned in
HRS_Processing.txt)
Link in the decedent's Medicare crosswalk id to the claims and
relevant information (dob, dod, zip code) from the HRS restricted dataset
Variables from the exit interview have suffix _x
Variables from the restricted dataset have suffix _e

Key decisions made:
Zip code brought in for each decedent is the zip code from the exit interview
(presumbably the decedent's zip code at time of death). For 2 observations,
exit wave zip was missing and the zip code from the previous wave was used.

********************************************************
**Pull core interviews**
********************************************************
Begin with cleaned core interview dataset (again cleaned in HRS_Processing.txt)
and gets datasets of the interviews 1, 2 and 3 waves before death (referred
to as the n1, n2 and n3 interviews)
The n3 dataset is limited to R's level of education variable since
that question was only populated from 2004 and earlier in the core interviews
(it is asked of new R's each wave, but only backfilled from the 1st interview
through the 2004 wave)

The n1 and n2 core interviews are then supplmented with the predicted
probability of dementia from the dataset "Dementia Predicted Probabilities Files
v 1.0" from the Researcher Contributions HRS downloads section

Dementia probablities are only calculated for interviews where
the respondant age is 70 or older at the time of the interview

********************************************************
**Merge HRS interview dataset, get n1, n2, restr, exit, mc xw**
********************************************************
First, renames variables in each of the core +dementia probability
datasets to have _n1, _n2 or _n3 suffix so can track which interview
they came from upon merging into single dataset

Adds the n1, n2 and n3 variables to the exit/restricted/crosswalk dataset

********************************************************
**Set up denominator file data, check vs interview dataset,
keep age ge 67 at death**
********************************************************
The Medicare claims denominator file contains general information
about each beneficiary (gender, race, etc) as well as their Medicare
status (whether they receive parts A+B medicare, whether they
use an HMO plan) that are used to determine sample elgibility

Denominator file is sorted and a dataset saved that keeps only the
last year for which each beneficiary has an entry

The HRS interview dataset is saved limiting it to just those
decedents that were age=67+ at time of death
Age at time of death is calculated from the restricted dataset
only at this point, using the death date and birth date from HRS

A pared down dataset is created limited to those decedents with
Medicare crosswalks and age 67+ at death, this is the initial
step in getting down to the sample used in the analysis

********************************************************
**Check to see if medicare and no hmo for 2 and 5 years
before death**
********************************************************
Uses the claims denominator file to create two sets of indicator variables
part_ab_2y / part_ab_5y - Indicator =1 if Medicare Parts A&B 2,5 years before death
hmo_2y / hmo_5y - Indicator =1 if HMO 2,5 years before death
So to be included in the sample, part_ab_xy==1 & hmo_xy==0

Variables are missing if denominator file information is not available
for the full 2 or 5 year period before death (in many cases this is because we
only have claims starting in 2000)

********************************************************
**Initial set up of OOP dataset (create id, drop unneeded vars)**
********************************************************
Imports oop and helper datasets into sas (received as Stata files)
Creates the id variable (hhid+pn)
Drops variables not needed for the analysis
Replaces missing values for OOP spending and helper counts with zero's
Merges the helper and oop datasets by id (oop_int.oop_helper data file saved)
Adds indicator for missing helper information for observations
with no helper data

********************************************************
**Accounting for missing nh nights, part 1**
********************************************************
Starts with oop/helper dataset
Brings in exact interview dates from the restricted file (exit interview
dates are set to the date of death, not the actual exit interview date)
Calculates SNF nights, both Medicare paid (los_snf_paid_by_mc_ivw ) and total
days regardless if Medicare paid (snf_stay_all_ivw ) during the time between
interviews from the medpar claims list
For stays that span interviews, stay length is truncated to only
included days within the time window of interest

Compares the self reported number of nursing home nights from the OOP dataset
(as estimated from the HRS interviews) (sr_nh_nights) to the total number of nights
from the claims (snf_stay_all_ivw). Whichever is greater is the total number of
nursing home nights attributed to that interview time period (nh_nights)

Determines observations where there are nursing home nights that aren't paid by
Medicare (nights = nh_ni_not_mc, indicator = nh_pmt_imp)

********************************************************
**Missing nh nights, part 2, assign prices**
********************************************************
Bring in supplemental data:
1. Average state private room nursing home nightly rate from the 
2010 MetLife Market Survey of Long-Term Care Costs
2. State Medicaid nursing home nightly rate from various sources
See the data in the subfolder \nh_costs_by_state for details
3. Private home health aide hourly rate from MetLife survey
   (used for helper replacement cost imputations)

Medicaid rates are inflated to 2010 dollars
These prices are merged in by the state reported in the interview time period
from the restricted dataset (so a single R can have more than one set of prices
if they move between waves)
State is imputed if missing, using the response from additional waves

Number of nights covered by the reported OOP spending NH category (NH_OOP) are imputed
using either the private price or Medicaid price. If Medicaid coverage (md_cov) is missing,
then the Medicaid price is used. oop_nh_nights = NH_OOP/price
If the calculated OOP nights are more than the total nights (nh_nights) either from
the survey or claims, then the OOP nights are capped at the balance of total nights - Medicare nights
(Indicator of capped OOP nights = oop_nh_nights_adj)

Any remaining nights not either paid by Medicare or accounted for in OOP spending
are assigned to variable other_nh_nights

Remaining nights are either assigned the Medicaid price or Private payer price
to get imputed nursing home payments
(nh_cost_medicaid and nh_cost_private)

So components used to impute total NH costs are:
nh_OOP nh_cost_medicaid nh_cost_private
These are at the interview level, so they just span the time period
that is between successive interviews, they will get added to span the 2 or 5 year
period with the rest of the OOP data in the "OOP spending totals 24,60 months..."
heading section

********************************************************
**Accounting for informal home care**
********************************************************
In helper dataset, helpers in the _p, _d, _m categories
are included (and imputed where missing) in the helper_OOP category
So here, we only impute additional costs for the unpaid helpers in the
_u and _s categories  (other unpaid and spouse)

The variables hlphrs_s and hlphrs_u are hours/month helped (across
all helpers in the n_ count variables)

So cost per month is imputed by multiplying hourly rate * number of hours
Capped at $15,000/month following methodology in the OOP dataset imputation
for paid helper costs

Calculates OOP cost per month - helper_OOP_per_mo - for interview periods
that span more than 4 months because helper costs will be adjusted (original
helper_OOP attributed spending for 4 months of help only where the interview time periods
are longer. We will instead use the average of the current interview monthly amount and previous
interview montly amount to better account for people needing continuous care)

So, if no helper in the previous interview, then helper cost / month is assigned
for 4 months prior to the interview date only
If helper is present the previous interview, 4 months prior to current interview
are assigned at the current cost/month and then the remaining months in the interview
period are assigned the average cost/month between the current and previous interviews

So final variables are hh_s_cost_ivw, hh_u_cost_ivw and helper_OOP
where helper_OOP has been adjusted to account for continuous care throughout the 
interview time period

********************************************************
**Get OOP data for exit, n1, n2 and n3 cores**
********************************************************

********************************************************
**Link in wage index by patient zip code**
********************************************************
Matches wage index by zip code from exit interview year. If no associated
wage index by zip code, then match by state code, agan from exit year.

Saves to a Stata dataset for the next steps

********************************************************
**Adjust for wage index and calculate total Medicare spending**
********************************************************
Adjusts Medicare 2 and 5 year spending category totals by the wage index
Adjustment done by regression to normalize means so mean before
adjustment is equal to mean after

Calculates total spending before and after wage index adjustment

********************************************************

********************************************************
**Merge mc spending into oop file
********************************************************
Merges the interview + OOP dataset with the Medicare totals
Observations with missing wage index have wage index set to 1
in this version of the MC totals so the wage index adjusted
Medicare costs are not missing

********************************************************
**Table with sample size 2 and 5yr lookbacks
********************************************************
Defines original sample with full 2 year information
Age > 67 at death
With Medicare xwalk, full insurance info last 2 years of life,
fee for service Medicare and full OOP data
Drops observations that don't meet 2 year criteria, tabulates
n observations that also meet 5 year criteria
Creates table "2-oop_sample.rtf"

********************************************************
**Look at dementia samples
********************************************************

Creates tables in "oop_dem_initial_tables.rtf"

********************************************************
**Create new variables for disease groups,demo char
********************************************************
Adjusts HRR DA level EOL spending for inflation and the wage index

Adjusts Medicare spending categories for the wage index

********************************************************
**Mutually exclusive comparison groups
********************************************************

********************************************************
**Quintiles work, check DA vs HRS
********************************************************

********************************************************
**25%, middle, 75% split - check DA vs HRS
********************************************************


********************************************************
**Adjust spending categories by age,sex,race
********************************************************
Creates quartile and quintile variables based on the inflation and wage index
adjusted Dartmouth 2 year EOL HRR level spending
Adjusts 2 year and 5 year spending variables for age, sex and race - variables
prefixed by adj_
Does second round of adjustments adding in ever smoked cigarettes, 
ADL status from exit, count of comorbidities and education level as
a comparison - variables prefixed by jadj_
Pulls select survey question responses (insurance coverage, net worth,
marital status) at approximately 5 years and 2 years before death
Selects the interview nearest to those times so can be different
interviews for different R's

This saves the 5 year sample version of the dataset for the rest
of the analyses / tables that follow in the code
