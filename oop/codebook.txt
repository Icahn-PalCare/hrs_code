This codebook file documents the decisions made when coding the
data cleaning and imputations for the dataset created in
the file oop_mc_2010_2yr.txt along with a summary of the
sections in the outline text file

General project description:
Tabulate out of pocket costs, medicare paid costs and impute additional
nursing home costs and replacement costs of informal, unpaid, caregivers
in the last 2 and 5 years of life.
Original datasets include the HRS surveys (2002-2010 exit interviews,
1998-2008 core interviews, and the restricted dataset received in Nov. 2013),
the oopme_final.dta dataset recieved in July 2013,
and the helpers_hours.dta dataset received in May 2014, and
HRS linked Medicare claims 2000-2010.

********************************************************
**Pull exit and restricted interviews and mc xwalk id**
********************************************************
Begin with the cleaned exit (decedent) interview dataset (cleaned in
HRS_Processing.txt)
Link in the decedent's Medicare crosswalk id to the claims and
relevant information (dob, dod, zip code) from the HRS restricted dataset
Variables from the exit interview have suffix _x
Variables from the restricted dataset have suffix _e

Key decisions made:
Zip code brought in for each decedent is the zip code from the exit interview
(presumbably the decedent's zip code at time of death). For 2 observations,
exit wave zip was missing and the zip code from the previous wave was used.

********************************************************
**Pull core interviews**
********************************************************
Begin with cleaned core interview dataset (again cleaned in HRS_Processing.txt)
and gets datasets of the interviews 1, 2 and 3 waves before death (referred
to as the n1, n2 and n3 interviews)
The n3 dataset is limited to R's level of education variable since
that question was only populated from 2004 and earlier in the core interviews
(it is asked of new R's each wave, but only backfilled from the 1st interview
through the 2004 wave)

The n1 and n2 core interviews are then supplmented with the predicted
probability of dementia from the dataset "Dementia Predicted Probabilities Files
v 1.0" from the Researcher Contributions HRS downloads section

Dementia probablities are only calculated for interviews where
the respondant age is 70 or older at the time of the interview

********************************************************
**Merge HRS interview dataset, get n1, n2, restr, exit, mc xw**
********************************************************
First, renames variables in each of the core +dementia probability
datasets to have _n1, _n2 or _n3 suffix so can track which interview
they came from upon merging into single dataset

Adds the n1, n2 and n3 variables to the exit/restricted/crosswalk dataset

********************************************************
**Set up denominator file data, check vs interview dataset,
keep age ge 67 at death**
********************************************************
The Medicare claims denominator file contains general information
about each beneficiary (gender, race, etc) as well as their Medicare
status (whether they receive parts A+B medicare, whether they
use an HMO plan) that are used to determine sample elgibility

Denominator file is sorted and a dataset saved that keeps only the
last year for which each beneficiary has an entry

The HRS interview dataset is saved limiting it to just those
decedents that were age=67+ at time of death
Age at time of death is calculated from the restricted dataset
only at this point, using the death date and birth date from HRS

A pared down dataset is created limited to those decedents with
Medicare crosswalks and age 67+ at death, this is the initial
step in getting down to the sample used in the analysis

********************************************************
**Check to see if medicare and no hmo for 2 and 5 years
before death**
********************************************************
Uses the claims denominator file to create two sets of indicator variables
part_ab_2y / part_ab_5y - Indicator =1 if Medicare Parts A&B 2,5 years before death
hmo_2y / hmo_5y - Indicator =1 if HMO 2,5 years before death
So to be included in the sample, part_ab_xy==1 & hmo_xy==0

Variables are missing if denominator file information is not available
for the full 2 or 5 year period before death (in many cases this is because we
only have claims starting in 2000)

********************************************************
**Initial set up of OOP dataset (create id, drop unneeded vars)**
********************************************************
Imports oop and helper datasets into sas (received as Stata files)
Creates the id variable (hhid+pn)
Drops variables not needed for the analysis
Replaces missing values for OOP spending and helper counts with zero's
Merges the helper and oop datasets by id (oop_int.oop_helper data file saved)
Adds indicator for missing helper information for observations
with no helper data

********************************************************
**Accounting for missing nh nights, part 1**
********************************************************
Starts with oop/helper dataset
Brings in exact interview dates from the restricted file
