But need ICD-9 diagnosis code to link to lung disease

Lung disease:
A.Diagnosis of severe lung disease and qualifying lab values:**
	Bronchiectasis
	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
	Cystic fibrosis
	Diffuse interstitial lung disease
	Pediatric broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
	Widespread pulmonary neoplasm;
B.Diagnosis of other hypoxia-related symptoms or findings with qualifying lab values:**
	Erythrocytosis (hematocrit greater than 55 %)
	Pulmonary hypertension
	Recurring congestive heart failure due to chronic cor-pulmonale;
C. Other diagnoses of hypoxia-related symptoms or findings with qualifying lab values** that usually resolve with limited or short-term oxygen therapy:
	Asthma
	Bronchitis
	Croup
	Pneumonia.
